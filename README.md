# Chicago-Flight-Analysis

This R program performs analysis on the data of flights arrive in Chicago's O'Hare airport from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2020. The main tasks are:
- Check data sanity (whether there are missing)
- Summarize metrics for months and years
- Visualization (charts and tables)

The interested metrics here are:
- Total passengers (by months and years)
- Total flights ((by months and years)
- Wait time (by time of the week and US vs non-US passengers)
- Booth rate (by days of the week and time of a day)
